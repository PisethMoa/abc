    <h1>Pangolin</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Pangolins, sometimes know as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Piseth Mao, "horny
        scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the
        four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan
        Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangol in species are
        also know.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this
        feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
        consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary
        animals, meeting only to mate and produdce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
        years.</p>
    <h2>Poaching</h2>
    <p>Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scale, which are used in Chinese traditional medicine)
        and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world. As of
        January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M. pemtadactyla and M. javanica) are
        listed as critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) arae
        listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smtsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable in the Red
        List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
